- Inspected the data for missing values and data types.

## Data Preprocessing
- Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.

## Model Training and Initial Evaluation
- Trained a decision tree classifier.
- Evaluated the model with accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

## Feature Importance Analysis
- Analyzed and visualized feature importances.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
- Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
- Retrained the model with the best parameters.
- Evaluated the tuned model.
